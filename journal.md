Hi there, this is my journal where I share continuous updates and insights about our robot's performance and advancements.

**We started building the base of our robot!**

During the class on Thursday, we were guided by Prof. Shiloh to build the base of our robots. Using our previous knowledge of soldering, we have soldered and extended the motors' wires, and then proceeded to attach the hubs and other parts to get the motors with their wheels ready. 

In the work area, we have used the wooden plank as the base (given to us by the Professor) and mounted these motors onto it. There was a lot of back and forth with regard to what to screw/fit first, but we finally understood the assignment. We then measured the plank and planned the holes to drill. After drilling, we have managed to attach 2 motors, and now need to attach the _____. 

Here are a few images of our process:

Ahsen and I came together to discuss and agree on a single character as we both had 2 inidivual characters. We agreed on Mrs. Peacock as she has a great potential to evoke strong feelings amongst the audience.

All the details can be found in Ahsen's journal.md found [here](https://github.com/ahsen10s/PerformingRobots/blob/main/journal.md)

#### Character Description: Colonel Mustard

Colonel Mustard is a former war profiteer who sold the radios out of military planes. He’s deeply ashamed of what he did and pays the blackmailer everything he has in order to keep his personal shame out of the papers. His chauffeur during the war informed Mr. Boddy about what he did, and in one of the versions, he murders him for it after suggesting everyone split up into pairs and search the house ([source](https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Every-Single-Character-Clue-Ordered-By-Greatness-40549.html)).

#### Special Features:
- Shirt and pant with suspenders and tie: Maybe add the adornment with medals for a distinguished look – making it more clear about his military background.
- An iconic moustache?
#### Construction technique:
- Mostly using cardboard, which is quick and easy to prototype.
