Hi there, this is our journal where we share continuous updates and insights about our robot's performance and advancements. <hr>

### Continuous Updates
All the updates after 28th October can be found on [Ahsen's journal linked here](https://github.com/ahsen10s/PerformingRobots/blob/main/journal.md#journal-ahsen-and-pranav)

### 28 October 2024

For the basic look and features:

For the motors and sensors we envision our robot to have:

### 3 October 2024

We continued working on the robot base, and drilled holes for the battery (after carefully marking things on the wooden base). Then, zip ties were used to hold the battery in place: a total of 2 main zip ties one running vertically and the other across.

**Questions out of presentations today**

- Linh's Presentation
  - Thought: She mentioned that Hirata encourages actors not to simply "look happier" but to "move in a certain way" to convey human nature. This idea can be translated to our play and the robots we create. It's not just about obvious facial expressions; voice plays a role, but subtle movements of the hands, ears, and even the eyebrows can also significantly contribute.
  - Question of mechanical looking robot vs. humanoid robot: I'd prefer to see a mechanical robot and not a humanoid robot. There is also a study by [Konok et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217306234?via%3Dihub), where they mention how it only gets difficult for people to accept a robot as it 'looks' more and more human or life-like. If we rather try to convey the same behavior through some other appearance, it's rather easier for people to be comfortable with such social robots.

- Toomie's Presentation
  - Ishiguro clearly disagrees with Konok et al.'s study, arguing that the more human-like the robots look, they enhance this interaction by creating a better sense of presence and engagement for the user.
  - The concept of uncanney valley – it's indeed very scary to even think of such robots co-existing with us, especially when they question what the difference is between us and them (the video shown in the presentation).
    -   But at the same time, how will the next generation look at our current scary future? Will this be a new normal for them as they begin growing up in such environments – will we get there in terms of technology?

**Continuing building the base of our robot**

We measured exactly how much leeway the angle of the wheels and casters of the robot base must have to navigate the ups and downs on the ground (especially in the Black Box and while exiting the IM Lab) – this can be handled by giving the casters a height slightly lower than that of the wheels powered by the motors. We used screws in this process instead of nuts and bolts in the previous process, as the wood was quite thick and we would need extremely long nuts if we were to use them.

The next step was to drill a hole in the center for the wires from the motors to be accessible from the top. We then marked out where the arduino, battery, and the motor driver are going to rest. The next steps are to continue working on drilling the holes and using zip ties to hold the battery in place, and screwing the motor driver and the arduino to the wooden base.

Here are a few images of our process:

### 19 September 2024
**We started building the base of our robot!**

During the class on Thursday, we were guided by Prof. Shiloh to build the base of our robots. Using our previous knowledge of soldering, we have soldered and extended the motors' wires, and then proceeded to attach the hubs and other parts to get the motors with their wheels ready. 

In the work area, we have used the wooden plank as the base (given to us by the Professor) and mounted these motors onto it. There was a lot of back and forth with regard to what to screw/fit first, but we finally understood the assignment. We then measured the plank and planned the holes to drill. After drilling, we have managed to attach 2 motors, and now need to attach the _____. 

Here are a few images of our process:

### 18 November 2024
Ahsen and I came together to discuss and agree on a single character as we both had 2 inidivual characters. We agreed on Mrs. Peacock as she has a great potential to evoke strong feelings amongst the audience.

All the details can be found in Ahsen's journal.md found [here](https://github.com/ahsen10s/PerformingRobots/blob/main/journal.md)

(Link to the [murder mystery collaborative outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14n8aM1Zh9eJmkvJriH-87WQnF9FcQNhilrOcNERecpM/edit))
#### Character Description: Colonel Mustard

Colonel Mustard is a former war profiteer who sold the radios out of military planes. He’s deeply ashamed of what he did and pays the blackmailer everything he has in order to keep his personal shame out of the papers. His chauffeur during the war informed Mr. Boddy about what he did, and in one of the versions, he murders him for it after suggesting everyone split up into pairs and search the house ([source](https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Every-Single-Character-Clue-Ordered-By-Greatness-40549.html)).

#### Special Features:
- Shirt and pant with suspenders and tie: Maybe add the adornment with medals for a distinguished look – making it more clear about his military background.
- An iconic moustache?
#### Construction technique:
- Mostly using cardboard, which is quick and easy to prototype.
